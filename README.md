# 1-Billion-IP-Addresses

wrriten in Python

Fastest or the Most Efficent way to find a IP address (v4) that is not in a list of perhaps 1 Billion addresses?

One algorithm which I came up with that implements counting the frequency of all possbile numbers(n in n:n:n:n of the IP)
The other simply uses basic recursion.
Which one is faster?
